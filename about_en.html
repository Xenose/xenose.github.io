	    <p>
	       This page was written so that it could be viewed on a phone, computer or even the tty.
	       To achieve this goal only HTML and CSS could be used, instead of how I wrote my portfolio
	       in the past using JavaScript in a combination with HTML and CSS. The added benefit to this
	       approach was that loading times became almost instant
